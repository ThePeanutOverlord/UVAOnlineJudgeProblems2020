### Description:
Using satellite imaging technology, the Department of Natural Resources has compiled an inventory
of every tree standing on a particular day. You are to compute the total fraction of the tree population
represented by each species. The first line is the number of test cases, followed by a blank line.
Each test case of your program consists of a list of the species of every tree observed by the satellite;
one tree per line. No species name exceeds 30 characters. There are no more than 10,000 species and
no more than 1,000,000 trees. There is a blank line between each consecutive test cases. For each test case print the name of each species represented in the population, in alphabetical order,
followed by the percentage of the population it represents, to 4 decimal places.
Print a blank line between 2 consecutive test cases.
