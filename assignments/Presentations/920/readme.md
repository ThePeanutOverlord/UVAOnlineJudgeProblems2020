### Description:
For this task consider that: (1) for all coordinates (x, y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 30000 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 8848; (2)
the unit is the meter; (3) all the X-coordinates are pair-wise distinct; (4) the leftmost point has 0 as
X-coordinate and the rightmost point has 0 as Y-coordinate; (5) The total number of coordinates given
is n ≤ 100. The first line of input contains C (0 < C < 100), the number of test cases that follows.
Each test case starts with a line containing the number N of coordinate pairs. The remaining N
lines for each test case contain the coordinates defining the landscape. Each of these lines contains two
integers, x and y, separated by a single space. The first integer, x, is the X-coordinate, and the second,
y, is the Y-coordinate of the considered point.

Not many but I did look up a lot of stuff about basic algebra that I've forgotten to be able to calculate
the distance where the sun shines on a taller peak that has part that isn't illuminated
