### Description:
The input contains on the first line the number of test cases (N). Each test case consists of two input
lines. The first line of a test case contains an integer L, determining the length of the train (0 ≤ L ≤ 50).
The second line of a test case contains a permutation of the numbers 1 through L, indicating the current
order of the carriages. The carriages should be ordered such that carriage 1 comes first, then 2, etc.
with carriage L coming last. For each test case output the sentence: ‘Optimal train swapping takes S swaps.’ where S is an
integer.
