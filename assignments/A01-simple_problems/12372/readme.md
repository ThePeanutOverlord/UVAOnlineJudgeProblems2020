## 12372 - Packing for Holiday

### Description:

So to make things much simpler he bought another suitcase having same length, width and height,
which is 20 inches. This measurement is taken from inside of the box. So a box which has length,
width and height of 20 inches will just fit in this suitcase. He also decided to buy only rectangular
shaped boxes and keep a measuring tape in his pocket. Whenever he chooses one gift box, which must
be rectangular shaped, he quickly measures the length, width and height of the box. But still he can’t
decide whether it will fit in his suitcase or not. Now he needs your help. Please write a program for
him which calculates whether a rectangular box fits in his suitcase or not provided the length, width
and height of the box. Note that, sides of the box must be parallel to the sides of the suitcase.Input starts with an integer T (T ≤ 100), which indicates the number of test cases.
Each of the next T line contains three integers L, W and H (1 ≤ L, W, H ≤ 50) denoting the length,
width and height of a rectangular shaped box.
For each test case, output a single line. If the box fits in the suitcase in any orientation having the
sides of the box is parallel to the sides of the suitcase, this line will be ‘Case #: good’, otherwise it
will be ‘Case #: bad’. In your output # will be replaced by the case number.
Please see the sample input and sample output for exact format
