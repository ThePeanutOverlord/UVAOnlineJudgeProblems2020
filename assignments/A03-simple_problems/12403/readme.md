## 12403 - Save Setu
### Paige Champagne
### Description:

However, in this problem, you have to build a software that can calculate the donations. Initially
the total amount of money is 0 and in each time, two types of operations will be there.
1) ‘donate K’ (100 ≤ K ≤ 105
), then you have to add K to the account.
2) ‘report’, report all the money currently in the account.
The first line of input will contain T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) denoting the number of operations. Then there will
be T lines each containing two types of operations as given. You may assume that the input follows
the restrictions above.
