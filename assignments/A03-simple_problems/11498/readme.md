## 11498 - division of Nlogonia
### Paige Champagne
### Description:

The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains one integer K indicating
the number of queries that will be made (0 < K ≤ 103
). The second line of a test case contains two
integers N and M representing the coordinates of the division point (−104 < N, M < 104
). Each
of the K following lines contains two integers X and Y representing the coordinates of a residence
(−104 ≤ X, Y ≤ 104
).
The end of input is indicated by a line containing only the number zero. For each test case in the input your program must print one line containing:
• the word ‘divisa’ (means border in Portuguese) if the residence is on one of the border lines
(North-South or East-West);
• ‘NO’ (means NW in Portuguese) if the residence is in Northwestern Nlogonia;
• ‘NE’ if the residence is in Northeastern Nlogonia;
• ‘SE’ if the residence is in Southeastern Nlogonia;
• ‘SO’ (means SW in Portuguese) if the residence is in Southwestern Nlogonia
