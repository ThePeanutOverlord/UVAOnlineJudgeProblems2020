## 127 - Accordian Patience
### Paige Champagne
### Description:

Input data to the program specifies the order in which cards are dealt from the pack. The input contains
pairs of lines, each line containing 26 cards separated by single space characters. The final line of the
input file contains a ‘#’ as its first character. Cards are represented as a two character code. The first
character is the face-value (A=Ace, 2–9, T=10, J=Jack, Q=Queen, K=King) and the second character
is the suit (C=Clubs, D=Diamonds, H=Hearts, S=Spades). One line of output must be produced for each pair of lines (that between them describe a pack of 52
cards) in the input. Each line of output shows the number of cards in each of the piles remaining after
playing “Accordian patience” with the pack of cards as described by the corresponding pairs of input
lines.
