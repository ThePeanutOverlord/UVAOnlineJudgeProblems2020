## 727 - Equation
### Paige Champagne
### Description:

1. The infix expression to be converted is in the input file in the format of one character per line,
with a maximum of 50 lines in the file. For example, (3+2)*5 would be in the form:
(
3
+
2
)
*
5
2. The input starts with an integer on a line by itself indicating the number of test cases. Several
infix expressions follows, preceded by a blank line.
3. The program will only be designed to handle the binary operators +, -, *, /.
4. The operands will be one digit numerals.
5. The operators * and / have the highest priority. The operators + and - have the lowest priority.
Operators at the same precedence level associate from left to right. Parentheses act as grouping
symbols that over-ride the operator priorities.
6. Each testcase will be an expression with valid syntax.
